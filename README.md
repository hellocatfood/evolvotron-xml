# evolvotron-xml
Nice XML function files for Evolvotron.

Contributors welcome.

All the files are free to use in whatever way, I don't guarantee you'll like them. 

Obviously, to use them, you also need Evolvotron, you can download it here: www.bottlenose.net/share/evolvotron/ it's free&open source, but quite old. Maybe someone should update it.

Filenames are in format [what it looks like] [which one of different this-looking functions it is].[version number, not necessarily bigger=better, just different].xml Sorry for convoluted description, just see them. I'll post thumbnails sometime soon.
