# evolvotron-xml
Pretty XML function files for Evolvotron.

All the files are free to use in whatever way, but I don't guarantee you'll like the resulting images. ;-) 

To use them you also need Evolvotron, you can download it here: www.bottlenose.net/share/evolvotron/ it's free&open source, but quite old. I'm not involved in the Evolvotron, I just like to use it.

Filenames are informat: [what it looks like] [which one of different this-looking functions it is, not necessarily bigger=better, just different].xml 
Sorry for convoluted description, just take a look at the .png thumbnails and it should be clear.

If you want to contribute some pretty functions of your own, you're welcome. :)
